# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Research

This repository contains both Python and JavaScript implementations of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) simulations.

## Contents

- `simulation/` - Python implementation using PyGame, featuring Q-learning and DQN agents
- `js/` - JavaScript/React implementation for web browsers

## Python Simulation

The Python implementation provides a full-featured simulation environment with:
- Multiple agent types (Q-Table, DQN)
- Interactive controls
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Agent communication and cooperation mechanics

See the [simulation README](./simulation/README.md) for more details.

## JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript implementation offers a simplified version that runs in web browsers using:
- React
- Canvas for visualization
- Recharts for metric display

This makes the simulation accessible without requiring Python or any local installation.
